            <b>August 2018</b> <br><br>
             
            Event Volunteer, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London I worked as part of a team to run a duathlon
             activity for the Triathlon Trust for children and families attending the Hockey World Cup. I would
              explain the rules of the activity to individuals, time them and then put their time on a leaderboard.<br><br>
             
             
            <b>July 2017-September 2017</b><br><br>
             
            Voluntary Charity Shop Assistant, Aston Mansfield My role as an assistant included handling donations,
             sorting items in the store and serving customers which developed my communication skills and ability to
              work under pressure during busy hours. I gained enough trust from my manager that I was given the responsibility
               to open and close the shop on my own. <br><br>
             
            <b>2015</b><br><br>
             
            Voluntary Assistant Teacher, St Josephâ€™s Catholic Junior School, London I helped small groups of Year 4 students with
             their Maths work and their artwork. I also worked as part of a team with other assistant teachers to guide in-class 
             activities with the students. <br><br>

            Voluntary Assistant Teacher, Roger Ascham Primary School, London I helped Year 2 students with their Maths and reading
             comprehension skills. I assisted in helping organise activities such as painting and cleaning up after students when they
